### ✨ Welcome! ✨
I'm a 19 year old boy (he/him) currently in college. I mostly use GitHub for side projects and experiments.

My main languages are C++, C# and Python.
I like messing around with computers and I've broken stuff way more times than I'd like to admit.

#### What I'm working on
- A Doom mod about Sonic [![Sonic: Lock & Load](https://github.com/That1M8Head/That1M8Head/raw/main/NextButton.png "Sonic: Lock & Load")](https://github.com/That1M8Head/Sonic-LockandLoad)
- A command line application that feels like an OS [![EsosCMD](https://github.com/That1M8Head/That1M8Head/raw/main/NextButton.png "EsosCMD")](https://github.com/That1M8Head/EsosCMD)
- A launcher for Doom that gets you playing in less than ten seconds [![Instant Doom](https://github.com/That1M8Head/That1M8Head/raw/main/NextButton.png "Instant Doom")](https://github.com/That1M8Head/Instant-Doom)
- A college project based on Doom that is completely stupid [![DOOM 8](https://github.com/That1M8Head/That1M8Head/raw/main/NextButton.png "DOOM 8")](https://github.com/That1M8Head/DOOM-8) [![DOOM 8 (iOS)](https://github.com/That1M8Head/SpeedStriker243/raw/main/NextButtonBlue.png "DOOM 8 (iOS)")](https://github.com/That1M8Head/DOOM-8-iOS)
