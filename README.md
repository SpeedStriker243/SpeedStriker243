### ✨ Welcome! ✨
I'm a 19 year old boy (he/him) currently in college. I mostly use GitHub for side projects and experiments.

My main languages are C++, C# and Python.
I like messing around with computers and I've broken stuff way more times than I'd like to admit.

#### What I'm working on
- A Doom mod about Sonic [![alt text](https://github.com/SpeedStriker243/SpeedStriker243/raw/main/NextButton.png "Sonic: Lock & Load")](https://github.com/SpeedStriker243/sonicdoom)
- A command line application that feels like an OS [![alt text](https://github.com/SpeedStriker243/SpeedStriker243/raw/main/NextButton.png "EsosCMD")](https://github.com/SpeedStriker243/EsosCMD)
- A launcher for Doom that gets you playing in less than ten seconds [![alt text](https://github.com/SpeedStriker243/SpeedStriker243/raw/main/NextButton.png "Instant Doom")](https://github.com/SpeedStriker243/Instant-Doom)
