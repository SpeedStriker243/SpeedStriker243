### ✨ Welcome! ✨
I'm a 19 year old boy currently in college. I mostly use GitHub for side projects and experiments.

My main languages are C++ and C# (I used to use Python a lot but I don't as much anymore)


#### What I'm working on
- A Doom mod about Sonic [![alt text](https://github.com/SpeedStriker243/SpeedStriker243/raw/master/NextButton.png "Sonic: Lock & Load")](https://github.com/SpeedStriker243/sonicdoom)
- A program that configures and launches a Windows 98 VM [![alt text](https://github.com/SpeedStriker243/SpeedStriker243/raw/master/NextButton.png "Windows 98 Launcher")](https://github.com/SpeedStriker243/Windows98Launcher)
- A command that mocks you for bad spelling [![alt text](https://github.com/SpeedStriker243/SpeedStriker243/raw/master/NextButton.png "rid")](https://github.com/SpeedStriker243/rid-cpp)
